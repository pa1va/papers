## What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?

### Abstract

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the core component of the Ethereum ecosystem, responsible for interpreting and executing smart contracts. This paper provides an overview of its definition, functioning, characteristics, and limitations, while also highlighting its relevance in the broader context of EVM-compatible blockchains.

### 1. Definition

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a Turing-complete virtual machine that serves as the computational core of the Ethereum network. It can be understood as a “decentralized supercomputer,” capable of hosting and executing applications in a distributed manner.

### 2. Functioning and Purpose

The primary role of the EVM is to execute smart contracts, which are self-executing programs enabling complex transactions and the creation of decentralized applications (DApps).

These contracts are generally written in Solidity, compiled into bytecode, and then interpreted by the EVM.

This process is comparable to how high-level programming languages like Python are transformed into bytecode before being executed by a virtual machine.

### 3. Characteristics

One of the most notable aspects of the EVM is its isolated environment, which shields contracts from external interference, such as file systems or network processes. This ensures continuous and secure execution.

The EVM can be thought of as a “sandboxed V8 for Ethereum bytecode,” but with rules specifically designed for decentralization and consensus.

### 4. Limitations

Despite its innovations, the EVM faces challenges, the main one being execution costs. Gas fees may vary depending on the contract’s complexity and network demand, making costs unpredictable and requiring developers to adopt pricing strategies.

### 5. Expansion Beyond Ethereum

Although it originated within Ethereum, the EVM has expanded beyond this ecosystem. Several blockchains, such as BNB Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon, have adopted EVM compatibility, establishing it as a widely used standard in the smart contract sector.

### Conclusion

The Ethereum Virtual Machine is one of the pillars of modern decentralized computing. Its secure and standardized execution model has become a reference point for multiple blockchain networks, even though challenges such as Gas fees remain significant barriers to scalability and accessibility.
